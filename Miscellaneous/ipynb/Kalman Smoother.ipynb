    "A Kalman filter/smoother is an optimal estimator -- i.e. infers parameters of interest from indirect, inaccurate and uncertain observations. It is recursive so that new measurements can be processed as they arrive. If all noise is Gaussian, the Kalman filter minimises the mean square error of the estimated parameters.\n",

The classical Kalman Filter will generate the forward estimation of $x_t$ conditioned on data up to time $t$: $x_t^{t-1}, x_t^t, V_t^{t-1}, V_t^t$. By contrast, the Kalman Smoother will generate the posterior estimation of $x_t$ based on the complete observation data: $x_t^T, V_t^T$.\n",

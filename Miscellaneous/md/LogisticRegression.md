##### Thoughts about Logistic Regression

###### 1. LR is still a linear model
The decision boundary is a hyper plane decided by the weight vector.

###### 2. LR is a Maximum Likelihood method
The first interpretation of LR is to maximize the (Log) likelihood function.


###### 3. LR could be regarded as a minmium loss method 

The loss function is a logistic function, rather than a 0-1 function, because the later is not convex.
